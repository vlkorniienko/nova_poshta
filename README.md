Nova Poshta API Service

This project is a Golang service that handles requests to the Nova Poshta API. This project is intended to be a starting point for developers who want to interact with the Nova Poshta API using Golang. Currently, the project only handles a few requests, so you can add more functionality as needed.

You will need to add to .env file your API key:
NOVA_POSHTA_API_KEY=your-nova-poshta-api-key

git clone https://github.com/vlkorniienko/nova_poshta.git
cd nova_poshta
go mod download
